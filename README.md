This is a solution to the Word Ladder game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder 

Word ladder (also known as Doublets,[1] word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, 
laddergrams,[2] or Word golf) is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll. A word ladder 
puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words 
to link the two, in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ 
by one letter.
ex: COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD → WARM

Five-letter word ladders:
Donald Knuth used a computer to study word ladders of five-letter words. He believed that 
three-letter word ladders were too easy (although Lewis Carroll found six steps were required 
for APE to evolve into MAN),[1] and that six-letter word ladders were less interesting, since 
relatively few pairs of six-letter words could be connected with a word ladder.[3] Knuth used 
a fixed collection of 5,757 of the most common English five-letter words, excluding proper 
nouns. He determined exactly when two words of the collection had a word ladder between them 
via other words in the collection.[3] Knuth found that most words were connected to each other, 
and he also found that 671 words of the collection did not form a word ladder with any other 
words. He called these words "aloof", because "aloof" is itself an example of such a word.
